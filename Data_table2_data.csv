Tracking Natal Origins of Parasitized vs. Uninfected Monarch Butterflies Overwintering in Mexico,PLOS ONE,2015,"Long-distance migration can lower parasite prevalence if strenuous journeys remove infected animals from wild populations. We examined wild monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) to investigate the potential costs of the protozoan Ophryocystis elektroscirrha on migratory success. We collected monarchs from two wintering sites in central Mexico to compare infection status with hydrogen isotope (?2H) measurements as an indicator of latitude of origin at the start of fall migration. On average, uninfected monarchs had lower ?2H values than parasitized butterflies, indicating that uninfected butterflies originated from more northerly latitudes and travelled farther distances to reach Mexico. Within the infected class, monarchs with higher quantitative spore loads originated from more southerly latitudes, indicating that heavily infected monarchs originating from farther north are less likely to reach Mexico. We ruled out the alternative explanation that lower latitudes give rise to more infected monarchs prior to the onset of migration using citizen science data to examine regional differences in parasite prevalence during the summer breeding season. We also found a positive association between monarch wing area and estimated distance flown. Collectively, these results emphasize that seasonal migrations can help lower infection levels in wild animal populations. Our findings, combined with recent declines in the numbers of migratory monarchs wintering in Mexico and observations of sedentary (winter breeding) monarch populations in the southern U.S., suggest that shifts from migratory to sedentary behavior will likely lead to greater infection prevalence for North American monarchs.",O,Movement,Distance travelled,na,Monarch butterly,Danaus plexippus,Insect,Lepidoptera,Nymphalidae,Ophryocystis elektroscirrha,Protozoa,Non-breeding,Field,all,Single,Y,175,100,75,Not presented,12.78,Wald X2,<0.0001,1.00E-04,1,Infection status,-0.28,0.01,-0.56,0.02,0.02,"pes(0.0001,100,75) or chies(12.78,175)",Negative

Parasites had little effect on monarch survival or reproduction, except at the highest dose, Monarchs inoculated with 1000 spores per larva had decreased survival to eclosion, and this effect was more severe when larvae were inoculated at an earlier stage (first versus third instar).

The mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the most numerous and widespread dabbling duck in the world, and one of the most important natural hosts for studying IAV transmission dynamics. In order to predict the likelihood of IAV transmission between individual ducks and to other hosts, as well as between geographical regions, it is important to understand how IAV infection affects the host. In this study, we analysed the movements of 40 mallards equipped with GPS transmitters and three-dimensional accelerometers, of which 20 were naturally infected with low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV), at a major stopover site in the Northwest European flyway. Movements differed substantially between day and night, as well as between mallards returning to the capture site and those feeding in natural habitats. However, movement patterns did not differ between LPAIV infected and uninfected birds. Hence, LPAIV infection probably does not affect mallard movements during stopover, with high possibility of virus spread along the migration route as a consequence.",O,Movement,Local movements,na,Mallard,Anas platyrhynchos,Bird,Anseriformes,Anatidae,LPAIV,Virus,Migration,Field,all,Single,N,87,37,50,Not presented,0.538,t,>0.05,0.5,0,Infection status,-0.06,0.01,-0.12,0.05,0.05,"tes(0.538,37,50)",Negative

This diversity includes eight Haemoproteus and 10 Plasmodium lineages of which most probably represent good biological species. Contrary to expectation, the relative frequency of parasite lineages seemed not to change over the 17-year study period and we found no effects of the parasites on a male secondary sexual ornament (song repertoire size) and two measures of fitness (adult survival and production of recruited offspring). We discuss whether the absence of fitness consequences of the parasites might relate to the fact that we have studied the host at the breeding sites in Europe, whereas the transmission seems to take place at the wintering sites in Africa, where the naive birds encounter the parasites for the first time and the resulting primary infections likely make them sicker than during the chronic phase of the infection. The prevalence of the three most common lineages appeared to fluctuate in parallel with a periodicity of approximately 3-4 years.

In the colonially nesting cliff swallow (Hirundo pyrrhonota), we manipulated ectoparasite load (of cimicid bugs, fleas, and chewing lice) by fumigating adults and comparing annual survivorship of fumigated birds and non-fumigated control birds captured at the same time. Mark-recapture experiments over an 8-year period revealed that non-fumigated birds had an annual survivorship about 12% less than chat of fumigated birds, on average, but the effects did not vary with colony size. Based on the difference in survivorship between fumigated and non-fumigated birds, we estimated that parasitized individuals had an annual survivorship of 0.38, compared with 0.57 for non-parasitized birds. The parasite-caused reduction in survivorship was the equivalent of the host losing up to one year of lifetime reproductive success. Ectoparasites did not preferentially infest hosts of lower quality, suggesting that all birds in the population were at potential risk of suffering parasitism and the resulting reductions in survivorship.

Yearling breeders were infected at a significantly lower rate than adults, and no yearlings in wintering roosts were infected. Haemoproteus prognei might be more virulent in immunologically naive birds and cause high mortality in young birds during the stress of their first migration. Many birds became infected over three years and most maintained a chronic infection. Infected birds returned to the colony with the same frequency as uninfected birds. Infected adults tended to arrive at the breeding site ahead of uninfected adults. Clutch size did not differ, but uninfected females had lower breeding success than infected individuals.

Whereas sea trout remain in near-shore waters throughout their marine migration, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts typically move quickly offshore into oceanic waters. It might therefore be predicted that salmon smolts would be less vulnerable to coastal stressors and less likely to be negatively affected by infestations of sea lice early in their marine phase. Groups of microtagged, hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon smolts were fed either untreated pellets or pellets incorporating the in-feed sea louse treatment SLICE (emamectin benzoate) prior to eight experimental releases in three marine locations over a 3-year period. In total, 74 324 smolts were released and analysis of tag recaptures from returning adult salmon showed that emamectin-treated smolts experienced increased survivorship and were 1.8 times more likely to return compared with control fish. These results suggest that sea lice-induced mortality on adult Atlantic salmon returns in Ireland can be significant, and that sea lice larvae emanating from farmed salmon may influence individual survivorship and population conservation status of wild salmon in these river systems.",E,Survival,Annual survival,Parasite removal,Atlantic salmon,Salmo salar,Fish,Salmoniformes,Salmonidae,L. salmonis,Mites,Breeding,Field,all,Single,N,74324,37189,37135,Not presented,90.87,X2,0.001,0.001,1,Infection status,-0.03,0.005,-0.07,5.40E-05,0.01,"chies(90.87,74324)",Negative

These birds become infected when ingesting seed shrimps (Ostracoda) that act as intermediate hosts, largely while on migration across Western Europe. The prevalence ranged from 4% to 14% per year and increased significantly over time. This long-term trend was further supported by studying 366 teal shot in 2006-2008, for which prevalence of C. megalops was 27.6%. We found no evidence to suggest that this increase in prevalence has been caused by an increase in temperature, but eutrophication and an increase in duck densities are potential contributing factors. Adult teal were more likely to be infected than first-year birds and females more so than males, probably due to differences in diet and/or habitat use.

Ectoparasites, by definition, are those which incur costs to their host, but these costs may vary. Examples of avian ectoparasites are chewing lice which feed exclusively on dead feather or skin material; therefore, costs to their bird hosts are generally considered small. Theoretically, many possible proximate effects exist, like loss of tissue or food, infected bites, transmission of microparasitic diseases or reduced body insulation due to loss of feathers, which may ultimately also have fitness consequences. Here, we experimentally examined a possible negative impact of 2 feather-eating louse species (Meropoecus meropis and Brueelia apiastri) on male and female European bee-eaters (Merops apiaster) by removing or increasing louse loads and comparing their impact to a control group (lice removed and immediately returned) after 1 month. A negative effect of chewing lice was found on body mass and sedimentation rate and to a lesser extent on haematocrit levels. Males and females lost more weight when bearing heavy louse loads, and were more susceptible to infestations as indicated by the higher sedimentation rate.

This study investigated the use of a rapid, nonlethal, external examination to assess the condition of run-of-the-river juvenile steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss migrating from the Snake River to the Pacific Ocean. We compared the external condition (e. g., body injuries, descaling, external signs of disease, fin damage, and ectoparasite infestations) with (1) the internal condition of a steelhead as measured by the presence of selected pathogens detected by histopathology and polymerase chain reaction analysis and (2) out-migration survival through the Snake and Columbia rivers as determined by passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag technology. The results from steelhead captured and euthanized (n = 222) at Lower Monumental Dam on the lower Snake River in 2008 indicated that external condition was significantly correlated with selected measures of internal condition. The odds of testing positive for a pathogen were 39.2, 24.3, and 5.6 times greater for steelhead with severe or moderate external signs of disease or more than 20% descaling, respectively. Capture-recapture models of 22,451 PIT-tagged steelhead released at Lower Monumental Dam in 2007-2009 indicated that external condition was significantly correlated with juvenile survival. The odds of out-migration survival for steelhead with moderate or severe external signs of disease, more than 20% descaling, or severe fin damage were 5.7, 4.9, 1.6, and 1.3 times lower, respectively, than those for steelhead without these external conditions.

A correlation analysis between 1 sea-winter (SW) Atlantic salmon catch statistics from the River Orkla (a Trondheimsfjord river) and sea lice infections on the migrating smolts in the Trondheimsfjord was not significant. Up to 2% reduction in adult returns due to sea-lice infection was expected. In addition, experimental releases from 1996 to 1998 with individually tagged groups of hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon smolts given protection against sea-lice infection was performed. Higher recaptures of adult Atlantic salmon from 1998 treated smolts compared to the control group may correspond to high abundance of sea lice found on the wild smolt, and may indicate influence on post-smolt mortality. These studies indicate that post-smolt mortality in Trondheimsfjord is marginally influenced by sea lice infection; however, the methods for assessing wild smolt mortality might be insufficient. Higher infections of sea lice farther out in the fjord may indicate more loss in Atlantic salmon returns in some years.",E,Survival,Annual survival,Parasite removal,Atlantic salmon,Salmo salar,Fish,Salmoniformes,Salmonidae,L. salmonis,Mites,Migration,Field,all,Single,N,17799,8898,8901,Not presented,Not presented,Not presented,Not significant,0.5,0,Infection status,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,Negative

Intensity of Ichthyophonus infection was most severe in cardiac muscle but multiple organs were infected to a lesser extent. The mean heart weight of infected fish was 40% greater than that of uninfected fish, the result of parasite biomass, infiltration of immune cells and fibrotic (granuloma) tissue surrounding the parasite. Diminished swimming stamina is hypothesized to be due to cardiac failure resulting from the combination of parasite-damaged heart muscle and low myocardial oxygen supply during sustained aerobic exercise.

On the individual macroscopic level, Ichthyophonus hoferi infections in herring significantly reduced body condition (p < 0.01) and reproductive capacity (gonad weight, p < 0.001). Infection prevalence increased with age (p < 0.001, R(adj)(2) = 0.71). Prevalence in the catches strongly depended on target school size and was thus higher in trawl catches. We found strong seasonality in infection prevalence within years, with peaks in summer and winter. Summer peaks spatially formed an ""infectious belt'' off the west coast of Norway, consisting of infected fish unable to follow the migration routes to the feeding grounds. Prevalence varied also between years (p <= 0.001). Since 1992, it had declined from stock prevalence levels of 10%, down to almost extinction, with another major peak in 1999.

We conducted a meta-analysis of replicated manipulative field experiments concerning the influence of parasitism by crustaceans on the marine survival of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The data include 24 trials in which tagged smolts (totalling 283 347 fish; 1996-2008) were released as paired control and parasiticide-treated groups into 10 areas of Ireland and Norway. All experimental fish were infection-free when released into freshwater, and a proportion of each group was recovered as adult recruits returning to coastal waters 1 or more years later. Treatment had a significant positive effect on survival to recruitment, with an overall effect size (odds ratio) of 1.29 that corresponds to an estimated loss of 39 per cent (95% CI: 18-55%) of adult salmon recruitment. The parasitic crustaceans were probably acquired during early marine migration in areas that host large aquaculture populations of domesticated salmon, which elevate local abundances of ectoparasitic copepods-particularly Lepeophtheirus salmonis.

Using a prospective cohort study design with birds individually flagged during May-June 2006-2008, we evaluated resighting rates (a proxy for annual survival) between ATV-infected and uninfected birds at 1 yr after capture, testing, and measurement. Overall resighting rate was 46%, which varied by year and increased with relative mass of the bird when captured. Resighting rates were not different between AIV-infected and uninfected birds in any period. In multivariate analyses, infection status was also unrelated to resighting rate after controlling for year, day, state, sex, body size, mass index, or whether the bird was blood-sampled. Thus, apparent annual survival in ruddy turnstones was not reduced by AIV infection at this migratory stopover. However, it is unknown whether intestinal AIV infection might cause subtle reductions in weight gain which could negatively influence reproduction.",O,Survival,Annual survival,na,Ruddy Turnstone,Arenaria interpres morinella,Bird,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,LPAIV,Virus,Migration,Field,all,Single,N,1233,163,1070,Not presented,1.4,X2,0.24,0.24,0,Infection status,-0.03,0.005,-0.1,0.01,0.01,"pes(0.24,163,1070)",Negative

We measured how long individual eels exposed to a water current in a swimming channel with a steady-stream profile could withstand the water current. The parasites affected the swimming behaviour of eels in different ways. The maximum period of time the fish were able to swim against the current was not correlated with infection by A. crassus. In contrast, infection with I. multifiliis reduced the swimming time. The protozoan has a higher pathogenicity than the swimbladder nematode, at least in closed systems, where I. multifffiis is able to spread within a few days. Reduction in swimming capacity after infection with the ciliate averaged 47% compared to capacity prior to infection. Thus, our results do not support the previously suggested strong negative relation between swimming activity of eels and intensity of A. crassus infection, at least in the short-term. However, there are indications in the literature that the pathological effects of A. crassus on the eel swimmbladder may involve a higher energy demand, possibly manifested in a prolonged spawning migration. As a result, eels heavily infected with this parasite may arrive too late at the spawning site to participate in mating. This could ensure a selection of 'good genes'.",E,Movement,Endurance,Parasite addition,European Eel,Anguilla anguilla,Fish,Anguilliformes,Anguillidae,Ichthyophthirius multifiliis,Protozoa,Lab,Lab,all,Single,N,39,na,na,Not presented,Not presented,Not presented,<0.05,0.05,1,Infection status,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,Negative

The balanced distribution of feather holes (high prevalence, low aggregation) corresponds with the pattern of distribution of lice on colonial birds, and in the Barn Swallow.

However, actual variations in population size can often be driven by other demographic parameters, such as juvenile survival, when they show high temporal variability. We used capture-recapture data from a long-term study of a hunted, migratory species, the greater snow goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica), to assess temporal variability in first-year survival and the relative importance of natural and hunting mortality. We also conducted a parasite-removal experiment to determine the effect of internal parasites and body condition on temporal variation in juvenile survival. We found that juvenile survival showed a higher temporal variability than adult survival and that natural mortality was more important than hunting mortality, unlike in adults. Parasite removal increased first-year survival and reduced its annual variability in females only. Body condition at fledging was also positively correlated with first-year survival in treated females. With reduced parasite load, females, which are thought to invest more in their immune system than males according to Bateman's principle, could probably reallocate more energy to growth than males, leading to a higher survival. Treated birds also had a higher survival than control ones during their second year, suggesting a developmental effect that manifested later in life.

Low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) infection is thought to have negligible impacts on wild birds; however, effects of infection in free-living birds are largely unstudied. We investigated the extent to which LPAIV infection and shedding were associated with body condition and immune status in free-living mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), a partially migratory key LPAIV host species. We sampled mallards throughout the species' annual autumn LPAIV infection peak, and we classified individuals according to age, sex, and migratory strategy (based on stable hydrogen isotope analysis) when analyzing data on body mass and five indices of immune status. Body mass was similar for LPAIV-infected and noninfected birds. The degree of virus shedding from the cloaca and oropharynx was not associated with body mass. LPAIV infection and shedding were not associated with natural antibody (NAbs) and complement titers (first lines of defense against infections), concentrations of the acute phase protein haptoglobin (Hp), ratios of heterophils to lymphocytes (H:L ratio), and avian influenza virus (AIV)-specific antibody concentrations. NAbs titers were higher in LPAIV-infected males and local (i.e., short distance) migrants than in infected females and distant (i.e., long distance) migrants. Hp concentrations were higher in LPAIV-infected juveniles and females compared to infected adults and males. NAbs, complement, and Hp levels were lower in LPAIV-infected mallards in early autumn. Our study demonstrates weak associations between infection with and shedding of LPAIV and the body condition and immune status of free-living mallards.
